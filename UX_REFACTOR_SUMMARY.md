# Restaurant Dashboard UX Refactor

## Overview
Complete redesign of the restaurant dashboard to create a cleaner, more intuitive interface focused on the daily workflow of restaurant staff. The new design uses tab-based navigation with a dedicated "Ready" status for food awaiting drone pickup.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. Tab-Based Navigation
**Before:** Three vertical sections (Incoming, Active, Recent) all visible at once  
**After:** Three main workflow tabs with badge counts + secondary history menu

**Main Tabs (Always Visible):**
- 🔵 **Incoming** (gray) - New orders pending acceptance
- 🔵 **Active** (blue) - Orders being prepared
- 🟠 **Ready** (orange) - Food ready for drone pickup

**Secondary Menu (Hamburger):**
- ✅ **Completed** - Successfully delivered orders
- ❌ **Cancelled/Rejected** - Failed orders

**Benefits:**
- Focus on one workflow stage at a time
- Reduces visual clutter and scrolling
- Badge counts show order counts at a glance
- Easy navigation with single clicks

---

### 2. New "Ready" Status & Tab

**Problem:** No intermediate step between "food is done" and "order completed"  
**Solution:** Add "Ready" status representing food waiting for drone pickup

**Ready Tab Features:**
- 📞 **Call Drone** - Request immediate pickup
- ✅ **Confirm Pickup** - Mark order as delivered
- ⚠️ **Report Issue** - Report problems (damage, wrong order, etc.)
- ⏰ **Auto-banner** - Alerts if order waits >10 minutes

**Status Flow:**
```
Incoming → Active → Ready → Completed
   ↓          ↓        ↓
Rejected  Cancelled  (Same)
```

---

### 3. Context-Specific Actions

**Incoming Tab (pending):**
- ✓ Accept Order → moves to Active
- ✕ Reject Order → moves to history

**Active Tab (accepted/delayed):**
- ⏱ Mark as Delayed → updates status, stays in Active
- ✕ Cancel Preparation → moves to history
- 📦 Mark as Ready → moves to Ready tab

**Ready Tab (ready):**
- 📞 Call Drone → triggers mock API call
- ✅ Confirm Pickup → moves to Completed
- ⚠️ Report Issue → submits issue report

**History (completed/cancelled/rejected):**
- View-only, no actions available

---

### 4. Smart Alerts & Notifications

**10-Minute Warning:**
- Auto-banner appears in Ready tab if order waits >10 minutes
- "Nudge Kyte" button to remind them about pickup
- Banner pulses gently to draw attention

**Waiting Time Indicators:**
- Shows "Ready for X minutes" in order details
- Helps staff identify delayed pickups quickly

---

### 5. Visual Design Improvements

**Color Coding:**
- Gray: Incoming orders (neutral, needs action)
- Blue: Active orders (in progress)
- Orange: Ready orders (urgent, waiting for pickup)
- Green: Completed orders (success)
- Red: Cancelled/Rejected (failure)

**Badge Counts:**
- Red badges with pulse animation for pending actions
- Shows count on each tab (e.g., "Active (3)")
- Only visible when count > 0

**Clean Layout:**
- One tab visible at a time
- Large, clear action buttons
- Emoji icons for quick recognition
- Plenty of white space

---

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

**Database:**
```python
# New field in Order model
ready_at = DateTimeField(null=True, blank=True)

# New status choice
('ready', 'Ready')
```

**View Logic:**
- Sets `ready_at` timestamp when status → 'ready'
- Maintains `completed_at` for final completion
- Both timestamps visible in order details

**Migration:**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Frontend Changes

**New Components:**
1. `TabNavigation.tsx` - Main tab bar with badges
2. `TabNavigation.css` - Styling for tabs and dropdown

**Updated Components:**
1. `OrderSections.tsx` - Refactored for tab-based display
2. `OrderSections.css` - New styles for tab content
3. `OrderDetail.tsx` - Context-specific action buttons
4. `OrderDetail.css` - Ready tab buttons and alert styles
5. `App.tsx` - Added `ready_at` field to Order interface

---

## User Workflow Examples

### Accepting New Order
1. Click **Incoming** tab (badge shows count)
2. Click order card to view details
3. Click **Accept Order** button
4. Order automatically moves to **Active** tab
5. Badge updates immediately

### Completing an Order
1. Order is in **Active** tab (being prepared)
2. Click order card to view details
3. Click **Mark as Ready** button
4. Order moves to **Ready** tab
5. Food is packed and waiting
6. Drone arrives and picks up food
7. Click **Confirm Pickup** button
8. Order moves to **Completed** (history)

### Handling Delayed Pickup
1. Order in **Ready** tab for 12 minutes
2. Auto-banner appears: "Ready for 12 minutes — Nudge Kyte?"
3. Staff clicks **Nudge Kyte** button
4. System sends reminder to Kyte backend
5. Staff can also **Call Drone** directly if needed

## Benefits for Restaurant Staff

✅ **Clearer Workflow** - One workflow stage per tab  
✅ **Less Clutter** - History hidden in secondary menu  
✅ **Faster Actions** - Context-specific buttons only  
✅ **Better Awareness** - Auto-alerts for delays  
✅ **Intuitive Design** - Color-coded, emoji icons  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly** - Responsive design

---

## Testing the New System

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && python3 manage.py runserver

   # Mock Kyte Backend
   cd mock_kyte_backend && python3 mock_server.py

   # Frontend
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

2. **Create test order:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/simulate-order
   ```

3. **Test the workflow:**
   - Order appears in **Incoming** tab
   - Click to view, then **Accept**
   - Check **Active** tab - order is there
   - Click **Mark as Ready**
   - Check **Ready** tab - order moved
   - Click **Confirm Pickup**
   - Check hamburger menu → **Completed**

4. **Test delayed pickup warning:**
   - Mark order as Ready
   - Wait 10+ minutes (or modify code to test faster)
   - Banner should appear automatically
   - "Nudge Kyte" button should be functional

---

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions:
- Real-time notifications (WebSocket)
- Bulk actions (accept multiple orders)
- Time estimates (prep time, pickup ETA)
- Order search and filtering
- Daily/weekly statistics dashboard
- Print order tickets
- Integration with POS systems

---

## Migration Notes

**Existing Orders:**
- Orders with `status='completed'` remain in Completed history
- No `ready_at` timestamp (shows as null)
- No data loss, all fields preserved

**Status Mapping:**
- `pending` → Incoming tab
- `accepted`/`delayed` → Active tab
- `ready` → Ready tab (new!)
- `completed` → History (hamburger menu)
- `rejected`/`cancelled` → History (hamburger menu)

---

## Design Principles

1. **Minimize Clicks** - Most common actions in 1-2 clicks
2. **Clear Hierarchy** - Primary workflow tabs vs. secondary history
3. **Visual Feedback** - Colors, badges, animations
4. **Intuitive Labels** - Plain language ("Mark as Ready" not "Update Status")
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show details only when needed
6. **Consistent Patterns** - Same button styles, same interactions

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Orders organized by workflow stage (not mixed)
- ✅ Ready step prevents confusion about completion
- ✅ Auto-alerts reduce forgotten orders
- ✅ Badge counts provide at-a-glance status
- ✅ Color coding aids quick recognition
- ✅ Single-click tab switching
- ✅ Context-specific actions only
- ✅ Clean, uncluttered interface
